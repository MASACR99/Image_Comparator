# Image_Comparator
Opens a terminal and prompts you with instructions to open a folder and start looking for repeated images inside it and all sub-folders, after that based on your selection it will delete images automatically, show the names of the files or prompt you to manually delete each of them. In case you want to compile the code you need opencv and boost filesystem, all the .dll is included in the latest release and is needed for the .exe to work. Enjoy :3
